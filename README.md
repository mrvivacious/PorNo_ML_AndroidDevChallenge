# porNo_open_source
Welcome! This is meant to provide a free and public algorithm for porn detection.
<br>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porno-porn-blocker-beta/fnfchnplgejcfmphhboehhlpcjnjkomp" target="_blank">Test the algorithm</a>.

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.mrvivacio.porno">Try out the Android app</a>.
<br>
### Some ideas for contributing:
<ul>
<li>
Speed improvements! For example, a program meant to block porn on the internet shouldn't let any part of the site visited
load before the assessment of the site is complete -- it's important to have an assessment faster than the speed of pageload, hence the importance of speed improvements.
</li>

<li>
Expanding the list of porn sites hardcoded in the file! 
</li>

<li>
Making this repo more "formally open source-y and proper"
</li>

<li>
Others to be determined later!
</li>

</ul>

Thank you!
